# alu-web-development
In this project I worked on both HTML and CSS 
## 1. HTML 
In this part of the project I worked on both the basics and advanced parts of HTML exploring different types of commands used nto make the coding possible.
Two HTML files were created namely index.html (https://github.com/N-SilverJr/alu-web-development/blob/main/html_basic/index.html) and tweets.html
